NOTE:

This is my project for a course in UCAS. Please do NOT paste these code on web!

Description:

This is a library that can parse Ethernet, ARP, IPv4, IGMP, ICMP, TCP, UDP protocol. Each protocol has a parser for it and all these parses are derived from ProtocolParserBase.

Also there is a wrap for WinPcap to make WinPcap OO.

IDE: Eclipse or VS2010

Configure: Add WinPcap/include to include path and add wpcap.lib and ws2_32.lib to additional library
